This database has >190 qubits, >70 papers, with that number continually growing. In the immediate future, information about gates will be added.

## Using the csv database

The file `processing_EXAMPLE.ipynb` gives an example of importing the provided database `fluxonium.csv` file into a `pandas.DataFrame` python object and generating the plot above. 

## Access to Notion database

The database also lives in Notion, which has many nice visualization tools as well as images of all fluxonium devices reported. This has been quite useful. Please fill out the form below if you would like access:
